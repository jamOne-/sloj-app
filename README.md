# sloj-app

A simple Vue.js project for managing my and my roommates bills/debts.

Application is hosted at https://sloj-app.herokuapp.com (the registration is closed -- you can not create new account, sorry).

## Build Setup

To run the app, you will need Node.js and MongoDB.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# start server
npm start

# (dev) serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
# it needs running server at port 3000 for api calls
npm run dev
```
